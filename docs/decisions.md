# TinyBar decisions

The running record of what has been decided, and why. The product manager keeps it current; everyone on the team reads it before starting work. When a decision changes, edit the entry and note the date. Don't delete history.

## Product

- **What it is:** a status bar for a desk in an **open office** that tells the people nearby whether it's a good time to interrupt.
- **Hardware:** Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-3.49, **V2** board (V2 sticker on the case, "Rev1.1" silkscreen). The 3.49" 172 × 640 screen is used in landscape as 640 × 172.
- **Power:** runs on **USB**. No battery for now (the 1,000 mAh cell the user tried is rated below the board's 1.2 A charge current).
- **Firmware:** **ESP-IDF with LVGL 9**, started once the mock-up is final.
- **The mock-up comes first.** `docs/mockup.html` is the source of truth for screens and behavior, and is published as an Artifact (https://claude.ai/artifact/NDTZFnXwKTypeGx3zEnDes). **Keep it up to date with every change**, including its notes, controls table and diagrams.
- **Language:** American English. **Copy:** nothing that implies a private office (no "come in", "knock", "door").

## Statuses

- Manual: Available, Busy, In a meeting, Pomodoro, Away, Message, Clock (idle).
- Automatic: **In a meeting** from the calendar, and **On a call** from the Mac app (see Automatic status).

## Controls

- Tap: next status (on the Pomodoro screen, start or pause). Swipe: previous or next status. Hold: quick menu (timer menu on the Pomodoro screen).
- BOOT: next status. PWR press: screen off or on. PWR hold 3 s: power off; a press turns it back on.
- Flip the bar over: turns the layout the right way up, silences any alarm, and starts whatever the Pomodoro is waiting for. A running timer is left alone; a flip never skips anything.
- **No dead ends:** every control does something in every state, every screen has a way back, menus have a Done tile and close after 8 s, and every action shows a short confirmation.
- A dark screen wakes on the first tap or button press. A ringing alarm is answered by any tap, hold, swipe, button or flip.

## Pomodoro

- 25-minute focus, 5-minute short break, 15-minute long break after every 4th session. All adjustable from the Remote.
- When a phase ends, the alarm flashes and chimes every few seconds until answered, for at most a minute. Optional auto-start skips the alarm screens.
- The timer keeps running when another status is shown (a countdown pill appears in the corner).
- Stop ends the run, keeps today's tomatoes, and returns to the previous status.
- **Tomatoes:** PixelLab pixel-art sprites with **no faces** (`assets/tomato_ripe.png`, `assets/tomato_unripe.png`, pixel-aligned). Finished sessions are red, upcoming ones faded red, and the current one **ripens like a real tomato**: from the blossom end up toward the stem, through yellow and orange to red.

## Wi-Fi

- Setup by QR code: the bar shows a QR code that joins the phone to its own `TinyBar-Setup` network, where a page lets the user choose the office Wi-Fi.
- Supports password and work-login (username plus password) networks. Guest networks with a sign-in web page are not supported; the setup page says so.
- Skip uses the bar offline: statuses and the Pomodoro still work; the calendar and Remote don't.

## Remote

- A web page served by the bar at `tinybar.local` on the office Wi-Fi.
- Setting the status from outside the office network (an online relay) is **deferred**.

## Automatic status (decided 2026-10-04)

- Two sources, usable **separately or together**:
  1. **Calendar:** the bar reads a **secret iCal address** (Google Calendar → Settings → the calendar → Integrate calendar → "Secret address in iCal format"). The user pastes it on the **Remote web page**, and can also paste it during Wi-Fi setup. Scheduled meetings show as **In a meeting** and fill in "Next up".
  2. **Mac app (built later):** a small menu-bar app that watches whether the Mac's microphone or camera is in use and sets **On a call**, catching unplanned Slack huddles and Google Meet calls. It talks to the bar over USB if the bar is powered from the Mac, otherwise over Wi-Fi. Only "on a call: yes or no" leaves the Mac.
- Not pursued: a Slack app (it would need workspace admin approval).
- The mock-up already reserves the bar's side of the Mac app (the On a call screen, the rules for which source wins, and the Remote's "Connect your Mac" section), so the app can be added later without redesigning anything.

## Mock-up-only tools

- The **Style panel** (fonts, colors, ripening slider with the USDA stages) exists only on the mock-up page as a design tool. None of it goes on the device.

## Hardware notes for the firmware (V2)

- Display: AXS15231B over QSPI. Backlight on **GPIO 42** plus the expander's BL_EN (EXIO1). LCD reset on the expander (EXIO5); TE on GPIO 21.
- Touch: AXS15231B over I²C (SDA GPIO 17, SCL GPIO 18).
- TCA9554 I/O expander: EXIO0 touch interrupt, EXIO1 backlight enable, EXIO2/3 IMU interrupts, EXIO4 RTC interrupt, EXIO5 LCD reset, **EXIO6 SYS_EN (power hold on battery)**, EXIO7 amplifier mode.
- PWR button read on **GPIO 16** (SYS_OUT); BOOT on GPIO 0; battery voltage on GPIO 4.
- RTC PCF85063, IMU QMI8658, audio codec ES8311.
- On USB the board is always powered; "power off" on USB means deep sleep woken by PWR.
- Battery connector MX1.25, **pin 2 positive**. Charger ETA6098 at 1.2 A. The board has battery protection and reverse-polarity protection.
- Flashing: merged images go at **0x0**; use **115200** baud (a faster write once left the screen showing noise).
